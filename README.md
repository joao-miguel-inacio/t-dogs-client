## Introduction :dog:

Nearing the end of the Ironhack's Web Development Bootcamp the ask was that we built a simple website using at least, 3 models, all CRUD operations, full authentication and authorization processes.

The Back End was to be developed with Node and Express.

The Front End was to be developed with React.

## The Idea :bulb:

An application for dog owners looking to sell or give a dog for adoption or for potential dog owners looking to adopt or to buy a dog.

### Dog Owners

Dog onwers can create as many dogs as they want and then manage each dog individually.

</div>


### Potential Owners

Buyers or users looking to adopt can browse through all the dogs available and can expect to be matched with the dogs we think would be perfect for them!

This will be based on what the buyers and the dog's needs are.
