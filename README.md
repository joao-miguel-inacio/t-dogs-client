## Introduction :dog:

Nearing the end of the Ironhack's Web Development Bootcamp the ask was that we built a simple website using at least, 3 models, all CRUD operations, full authentication and authorization processes.

The Back End was to be developed with Node and Express.

The Front End was to be developed with React.

## The Idea :bulb:

An application for dog owners looking to sell or give a dog for adoption or for potential dog owners looking to adopt or to buy a dog.

### Dog Owners

Dog onwers can create as many dogs as they want and then manage each dog individually.
